How to View the Website

Follow these instructions to open and view the website on your computer.

Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

1. **Download Visual Studio Code**:
   - Go to this website: https://code.visualstudio.com/
   - Click the **Download** button. The website should automatically suggest the right version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   - Once downloaded, **double-click** the file to install it and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

Step 2: Open Visual Studio Code

1. After installing, find **Visual Studio Code** on your computer.  
   - **Windows**: Click on the **Start** button (bottom-left corner) and type "Visual Studio Code." Click on it to open.
   - **macOS**: Open the **Applications** folder and double-click **Visual Studio Code** to open it.

2. You should see the VSCode welcome screen. If it appears, just click **Close** to dismiss it.

Step 3: Open the Website Files in Visual Studio Code

1. Inside VSCode, click **File** in the top-left corner of the window.
2. Select **Open Folder...** from the dropdown menu.
3. A file browser will pop up. Navigate to the folder containing the website files you received (it should have HTML, CSS, JS files, etc.).
4. Click the folder and click **Open**.

Step 4: Install the Live Server Extension (This will allow the website to run)

1. On the left side of VSCode, click the **Extensions** view (the icon that looks like four squares stacked together).
2. In the search bar at the top, type **"Live Server"**.
3. Click on **Live Server** by **Ritwick Dey** (the first result).
4. On the right side, click the **Install** button to install the extension.

Step 5: Open the Website in Your Browser

1. Go back to the **Explorer** tab on the left side (the first icon at the top).
2. Find the **index.html** file (or the main HTML file that opens the website).
3. **Right-click** on **index.html** and select **Open with Live Server** from the context menu.

4. Your default web browser should automatically open, and you will see the website running locally.

Step 6: Browse the Website

- You can now browse the website just like you would any other website.
- If you make changes to any of the website files, just **save** them in VSCode by pressing **Ctrl + S** (Windows) or **Cmd + S** (Mac). The browser will automatically refresh and show the updates.

Troubleshooting:

- **If the Live Server option doesn't appear**: Make sure you are right-clicking on the **index.html** file (or the file that opens the website).
- **Live Server not installing**: If you have trouble installing the Live Server extension, make sure your internet connection is working, or restart VSCode and try again.
